## Usage

### Config

First thing you need to set up is placing something like this either in initializer or in application.rb file:

```ruby
  RagicClient.config do |config|
    config.ragic_api_url = 'your ragic_api_url'
    config.ragic_api_key = 'Basic your_ragic_api_key'
  end
```

**Note: What you need to do is use the field ids of the fields as name, and the values that you want to insert as parameter values.**
